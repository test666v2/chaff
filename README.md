chaff.sh

Purpose: Add additional pseudo-randomness to /dev/random from 4 sources : date, iostat, temperature (please verify ahead in the script) and ping

Please install sensors package or set variable GET_ENTROPY_FROM_TEMPERATURE to false

The terms "random", "randomized" and "randomness" are here loosely used and do not mean "true randomness"

It would be better to have a reliable hardware RNG or install haveged and be less happy, or both, or to be a tin-foil hat moron and run chaff.sh alongside haveged

In a terminal window: 

>user@computer:~$ **/your/path/here/chmod.sh +x /your/path/here/chaff.sh"** to make the script executable

>user@computer:~$ **/your/path/here/chaff.sh** without arguments for a normal run

>user@computer:~$ **/your/path/here/chaff.sh --test** for building file $RANDOM_CHARS_FILE that can be tested against random number analysers (ent, rngtest, dieharder or any other tool)

>user@computer:~$ **/your/path/here/chaff.sh whatever** will produce a help message

run from cron as a local user: edit cron in a terminal window with "crontab -e" and add "@reboot /your/path/here/chaff.sh", save and exit and reboot
